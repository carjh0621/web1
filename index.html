    <p>
        A website (also written as web site) is a 
        collection of 
        web pages and related content that is identified 
        by a common domain name and published on at least 
        one web server.
        Notable examples are wikipedia.org, google.com, 
        and amazon.com.
        All publicly accessible websites collectively 
        constitute the World Wide Web. There are also 
        private websites that can only be accessed on a
        private network, such as a company's internal 
        website for its employees.
